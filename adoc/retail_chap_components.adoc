== Components


{smr} uses a layered architecture:

* The first layer contains the central server and one or more build hosts.
* The second layer contains one or more branch servers to provide local network and boot services.
* The final layer contains any number of deployed point-of-sale terminals.



.Central Server

The central server is a {susemgr} server.
It contains information about infrastructure, network topology, and everything required to automate image deployment and perform day-to-day operations of branches and terminals.
This can include database entries of registered systems, salt pillar data for build images, image assignments, partitioning, network setup, network services, and more.

.Build Hosts

Build hosts can be arbitrary servers or virtual machines.
They are used to securely build operating system images.
Build hosts should be based on {sls}{nbsp}12 SP{nbsp}3.


.Branch Server

Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-sale terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office.
Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, salt broker, and RPM proxy.
Depending on how you configure your branch server, it can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services.

The branch server layer can operate in several different network configurations:

* The branch server has a dedicated network interface card and terminals use an isolated internal branch network.
* The branch server manages the internal network and provides DHCP, DNS, PXE, FTP, and TFTP services.
* The branch server shares a network with the terminals, and provides a connection to the central server.
* The branch server does not manage a network, but acts as a PXE boot server and provides FTP and TFTP services.
In this configuration, it may or may not provide DHCP and DNS services.
